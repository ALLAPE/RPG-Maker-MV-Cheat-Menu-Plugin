Requires Cheat_Menu plugin installed as well (install order doesn't matter)

Back you shit up (mainly your plugins.js file) first, not my fault if it breaks something

Install

1)	Unpack Game if needed
	Use one of these tools: http://www.ulmf.org/bbs/showpost.php?p=830445&postcount=91

2)	Copy and Paste this contents of this folder into folder with Game.exe

3)	Patch your www/js/plugins.js

	a)	Backup your www/js/plugins.js file

	b)	Patch
			Run MVPluginPatcher.exe
				or
			Manually Add the following to your plugins.js file

			{"name":"Cheat_Menu_Cursed_Armor","status":true,"description":"","parameters":{}}

4)	Delete MVPluginPatcher.exe and plugins_patch.txt


Uninstall
1)	Delete www/js/plugins/Cheat_Menu_Cursed_Armor.js

2)	Remove plugin entry from www/js/plugins.js

	a)	Ideally you can just restore you backup of plugins.js

3)	Delete MVPluginPatcher.exe and plugins_patch.txt if you haven't already
